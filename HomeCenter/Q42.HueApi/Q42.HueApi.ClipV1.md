# Legacy documentation for Q42.HueApi
Q42.HueApi is deprecated. Please use the new HueApi package.

### Bridge
Before you can communicate with the Philips Hue Bridge, you need to find the bridge and register your application:

```cs
	IBridgeLocator locator = new HttpBridgeLocator(); //Or: LocalNetworkScanBridgeLocator, MdnsBridgeLocator, MUdpBasedBridgeLocator
	var bridges  = await locator.LocateBridgesAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

	//Advanced Bridge Discovery options:
	bridges = await HueBridgeDiscovery.CompleteDiscoveryAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
	bridges	= await HueBridgeDiscovery.FastDiscoveryWithNetworkScanFallbackAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
	bridges = await HueBridgeDiscovery.CompleteDiscoveryAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

```
	
Register your application
	
```cs
	ILocalHueClient client = new LocalHueClient("ip");
	//Make sure the user has pressed the button on the bridge before calling RegisterAsync
	//It will throw an LinkButtonNotPressedException if the user did not press the button
	var appKey = await client.RegisterAsync("mypersonalappname", "mydevicename");
	//Save the app key for later use
```

If you already registered an appname, you can initialize the HueClient with the app's key:	

```cs
	client.Initialize("mypersonalappkey");
```

### Control the lights
Main usage of this library is to be able to control your lights. We use a LightCommand for that. A LightCommand can be send to one or more / multiple lights. A LightCommand can hold a color, effect, on/off etc.

```cs
	var command = new LightCommand();
	command.On = true;
```
	
There are some helpers to set a color on a command:
	
```cs
	//Turn the light on and set a Hex color for the command (see the section about Color Converters)
    command.TurnOn().SetColor(new RGBColor("FF00AA"))
```

LightCommands also support Effects and Alerts
```cs
	//Blink once
	command.Alert = Alert.Once;
	
	//Or start a colorloop
	command.Effect = Effect.ColorLoop;
```

Once you have composed your command, send it to one or more lights

```cs
	client.SendCommandAsync(command, new List<string> { "1" });
```

Or send it to all lights

```cs
	client.SendCommandAsync(command);
```
